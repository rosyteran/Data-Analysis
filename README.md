## Music Taste and Self-Reported Mental Health (EXCEL)

## Project description
Music Taste and Self-Reported Mental Health

Music therapy, or TM, is the use of music to improve a person's stress, mood, and overall mental health. TM is also recognized as an evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin.

However, MT employs a wide range of different genres, which vary from organization to organization.
The MxMH dataset aims to identify what, if any, correlations exist between an individual's taste in music and their self-reported mental health. Ideally, these findings could contribute to a more informed application of TM or simply provide interesting insights into the mind.

With the help of auxiliary tables (Sum of hours by platforms, mental illnesses by platform), formulas (count, sum.if, average) and functions (lookup, match, if.set), views in class are able to highlight the most important data. important in the Dashboard.
